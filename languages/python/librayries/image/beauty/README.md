- [BeautyGAN](https://github.com/Honlan/BeautyGAN) - transfer the makeup style of a reference face image to a non-makeup face
- [RetouchML](https://github.com/ju-leon/RetouchML) - Enhances faces on images and automatically beautifies them using StyleGan2 and latent space exploration
- [ffhqr-dataset](https://github.com/skylab-tech/ffhqr-dataset) - FFHQR -- the first large-scale retouching dataset for computer vision research.
- [IP-Adapter-FaceID](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID) - An experimental version of IP-Adapter-FaceID: we use face ID embedding from a face recognition model instead of CLIP image embedding, additionally, we use LoRA to improve ID consistency. IP-Adapter-FaceID can generate various style images conditioned on a face with only text prompts.
